The “Skin Cancer Detection” project aims to build a smart system to support early diagnosis of skin cancer, especially melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer. It supports dermatologists in evaluating skin images from patients, reducing diagnosis time and increasing the ability to detect early. The project not only improves diagnosis efficiency but also contributes to raising public awareness of skin cancer, especially in areas lacking specialists.
